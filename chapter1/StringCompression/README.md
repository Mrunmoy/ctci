Hmmm..... 
function : `copy_original` isn't really required.
and I have a bit of duplicated code :disappointed:
but apart from that I think, it's pretty cool 
- Runs the length of string o nce for best case, when the compression works.
- It runs the lenght of string twice if the compression can't fit.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯  moving on to the next one....
